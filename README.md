# What Does This App Do?
What's For Dinner is a project that I'm starting during project two at WDI.  As someone who likes to cook, I want to have all of my recipes in one easy place so that I can quickly make decisions on what meals I'll be cooking during the work week, and make sure I get all of the necessary ingredients when I go to the grocery store.

To use the app, create an account and login!  You can quickly and easily add your favorite recipes.  When you want to do some meal planning, just login and you'll have all of your favorites just a click away.


# Approach to Building
When we were given this project prompt, I had a pretty good idea of what I was going to build.  From my experience in Project 1, I knew that I needed to plan ahead more this time.

Before project work time even began, I started working on an MVP.  I created all of my user stories and drew wireframes to make sure that I had a good sense of what content I needed.  I threw together a Bootstrap landing page, and added a similar authentication structure to what I used in project 1.  One thing I learned is that while I did a lot of pre-planning,  could have done even more!

Once work time started, I was well on my way to an MVP.  This allowed me to change my strategy.  I began a new process where unlike before, I wouldn't just sit and stare at my project, clicking around to determine my next workflow.  I took the time to write out the issues I wanted to solve, and then I tackled them one at a time.  This was a lightbulb moment for me, as the issues all got solved, my code felt cleaner, I was committing more, and I felt like I was making substantial improvements.  I will definitely follow a similar process in the future.

# The Work Continues
Among other things, here are some things I'd like to improve:

1.  Right now, ingredients are manually entered each time you create a recipe.  I'd love to create a database of ingredients, with helpful attributes like average cost, preferred location to buy, etc.  I think this would be a great way to get more data out of meal planning.

2.  UI improvements to the recipe board.

3.  I'd also like to make recipes sharable, so that you can share a good recipe with a friend.
